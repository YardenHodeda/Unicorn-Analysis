## About The Process
I downloaded this dataset from Kaggle that contains information about unicorn companies around the world. I had to clean it due to missing information in some cells and mistakes with names of countries and cities such as Singapore and The Bahamas. I then explored the data a little bit further, I created a special column for exits index by using formulas in Excel. I added filter that allowed me to work more efficiently. I also created a column for investors count brackets to present the in a more logical way. After that I proceed to creating pivot tables with the clean data. The pivot tables were used to create a data dashboard that presents the findings from the data set. In the dashboard I added a slicer to filter the result. 

## Top Findings 
1.	The leading countries by number of unicorn companies are U.S.A (536), China (168) and India (63).
2.	In the U.S.A leading states by number of unicorn companies are California (236) and New York (96).
